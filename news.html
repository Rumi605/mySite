                    <p>The passing of the baton, the changing of the guard – call it what you like. The simple fact is that Carlos Alcaraz is the new king of the Centre Court and Novak Djokovic, the mighty collector of Grand Slam titles, has been deposed.

                        Alcaraz defended his Wimbledon title with a masterclass, dismissing Djokovic 6-2, 6-2 7-6(4).
                        
                        “He had it all today,” Djokovic said. “He was an absolutely deserved winner today.”Alcaraz’s parents looked as proud as punch. Djokovic looked resigned to his future: young Carlitos standing between him and the 25th Grand Slam title he so desperately craves.

                        It was a fascinating match-up between the two champions, past and present, and no one – be they pundit, punter or player – could identify a clear favourite before the match.
                        
                        The problem was that the numbers were so one-sided as to be irrelevant. Titles won: Djokovic 98, Alcaraz 15. Grand Slam titles won: Djokovic 24, Alcaraz three. Wimbledon titles won: Djokovic seven, Alcaraz one. </p>
